# ðŸ§  Simple Python Spelling Game

This is a beginner-level spelling game written in Python. It randomly selects a word from a list and asks the user to type it correctly. Each correct answer adds to the score, which is displayed after every attempt.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This project was built as part of my early Python learning journey. I wanted to reinforce basic principles by making a real, working game I could play with my son â€” and later use for ESL teaching.

---

## ðŸ“š What I Practiced

- Using the `random` module (`random.choice`)
- User input handling (`input`)
- Looping with `for`
- Global vs local variables
- f-strings
- Basic debugging and step-by-step corrections

---

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

- How to pass and compare user input safely
- Why variable scope matters (`global`)
- The importance of indentation and colon use in Python
- How to give immediate feedback and track state (score)

---

## âœ… Planned Improvements

- Add error-handling for blank input or invalid characters
- Modularise the code (move logic into separate files)
- Let the word be spoken aloud using audio (voice-based version)
- Add a GUI or web-based interface later

---

## ðŸ”„ Next Steps

I'm committed to rewriting this project multiple times from memory to build fluency. Each time I will:
- Add new features
- Improve code clarity
- Document what I learn

## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

I'm a self-taught Python learner with a background in JavaScript. I'm rebuilding my knowledge from the ground up after a long break and combining it with ESL teaching to create helpful, real-world tools.
